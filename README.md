# feather-fall

Having this feather in your hotbar makes you light as it

## What's in the box

- A item when "held" will allow any negative velocity to become reduced to a slow enough speed that no fall damage will be taken
- Optional crafting of the feather
- Various functionality customizations in the mod settings

## How to enable crafting

Just add `feather_fall.craftable = true` to your `minetest.conf` (and restart if needed).

> First run will create this setting to false, so you could just run it first then edit your `minetest.conf`.
> Alternatively, you can enable crafting in the mod settings.

## Mod settings

# A switch to toggle craftability.
# A switch to disable gravity calls.
# The falling speed when the falling feather is "held".
